# Fashion Wizard (Similar Cloth Search using a Image Key) #
### Introduction: ###
Clothes are one of the most important needs of people. People usually go to the shopping mall to buy clothes. Moreover people buy clothes from online stores and it becomes popular day by day. There is a generation growing rapidly who loves new cutting edge technologies. These generations are the major consumers of different online stores. Also because of the Covid 19 pandemic situation, the online shopping trends and behaviours get the extreme boost. People are enjoying buying their regular products from online stores and the shopping clothes from online stores, has higher frequency than others.

Either in online or offline shopping, the consumer wants to receive a quick response from the seller, for example: to lookup clothes in the store etc. Statistics show that telephone conversation and prior waiting time make customers more frustrated, as a result, chatbots gain the customerâ€™s major attraction and 60% of customers experienced the usage of chatbots. They get responses more quickly than other mediums of conversations.

The use of voice assistants is another important reason of getting higher popularity in chatbots usage. According to Google, 20% of searches are voice searches using voice assistants. Moreover, 27% of people around the world use voice chat.

### Use Case Study: ###
In real life, when people want to buy specific or similar clothes from a clothing store(for example: H&M), people show a sample picture to the sales person. Then, the sales person displays the exact cloth or some clothes of similar patterns and textures. Taking the idea into image processing and deep learning, my proposed application will take an image as input for the search key and give the exact or similar clothes(similar patterns and textures) as output.

### Application Area: ###
This application could be used in the online store or chatbot. In the chatbot, the customer can give a picture of a cloth. The chatbot can quickly search that cloth in the store and display the exact same or some similar clothes to the customer. Here similarity means the similar patterns and textures in the clothes. It is a more time saving and effective way of cloth search in the online store using the chatbots. This also helps customers to make quick and correct decisions through visualisation of exact or similar clothes which have different colours and textures.
